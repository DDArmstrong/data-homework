# data-homework

1. The assignment is incomplete. I just did the weather piece, not the LastFM part. The assignment took so long that I was afraid that I wouldn't get to Pandas and woud fall even farther behind. Better to cut my losses and move on.

2. I'd like to apologize for the fact that my code is so unreadable and messy. I printed out and viewed all the lists and dictionaries so I would know how to get the specific data I needed later. Probably should have deleted everything except the pieces of codee that directly answered the questions.

3. I didn't bother to hide my API key. Sorry. Just too exhausted at the end, and too focused on moving on.


What the assignment was about

1. Learning to pull data from a remote server using and API
2. Writing, executing and sharing code using Jupyter notebooks
3. Sharing code using Github

Something you learned in the process
1. How to extract code from lists and dictionaries.
2. How to use Jupyter.
3. How to upload code 

Something you found challenging 
1. Syntax is a bitch.
2. The json is unreadable. Wish there was a way to parse the "wall of text" into a hierarchy of dictionaries and list, so it was easier to see when you needed key-value syntax vs list[0] syntax.
2. Some questions appeared to ask for things that weren't possible - for instance, history when the API requires a paid account for history, or forecasts a week out when the API appears to be limited to three days.
